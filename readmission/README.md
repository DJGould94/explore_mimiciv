# exploring icu readmission
Here are codes to gauge out icu readmission cases within 72hrs of icu discharge in mimic-iii, mimic-iv, and eICU. MIMIC-IV is a bit complicated and there could be better ways to handle it. In summary, the notebook is really exploratory and there could be some issues, so definitely let me know if you identify any issue. Finally, sorry about the typos in advance..
